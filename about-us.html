              We are group of 5 students of PICT, Pune who created this website as a project for the subject PBL. We
              tried our best to create a responsive website for the <b>‘RESUME BULDER WEBSITE’</b>.
              We believe that landing a job and building the perfect resume should be simple and that a poorly written
              resume should be the last reason for not getting the job that you want. We’re dedicated to make sure that
              doesn’t happen. Our objective is to simplify the task of creating a resume for individuals and to reduce
              tedious work in thinking and creating resumes make it convenient for users.
              Making Resume is a very hectic work for all the students. Also, many companies judge the candidature of a
              student just by his/her Resume. This was our motivation for choosing this topic for out project. It is
              necessary for the student to think beyond the third dimension while making the Resume. So, the existing
              system is very complex and making a resume via word files and excels is a tough task. So, this proposed
              online resume builder system provides the users a better way to show and customise their own resume
              according to their requirements.
              <br><br>
              It is an application that simplifies the task of creating a resume for individuals. The system is
              developed to provide an easy means for creating a professional looking resume. Individuals just have to
              fill up a form that specifies important credentials need to be filled & questions from all required fields
              such as personal questions, educational, qualities, interest, skills and so on. The answers provided by
              the users are stored and the system automatically generates a well-structured resume. Users have the
              option to create a resume in any format and file. The resume is downloadable in PDF format. Also, the user
              can log in again to access the previous resume that (s)he had made.
